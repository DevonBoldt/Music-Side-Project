Hello! First and foremost, welcome to my github profile! Feel free to look around and check what I’m up to. You can check my biography (shouldn’t it be an autobiography) to see my interests and what I am currently working on at the moment 

This project was conceived by a partner and I during my fall semester of 2019 during our CS 101 class. Our final project was creating randomly generated scales using python. 

As a junior CS major, I am starting to learn more and more about CS and I want to demonstrate my knowledge in a meaningful way. This combines two of my major interests, Music and CS.

I hope you enjoy this project and find use of it! 

In this project for simplicity: Sharps will be labeled as "#." For example: an A sharp would be "A#" Flats will be labeled as "b." For example:  a B flat would be "Bb" 

As of right now, I adhere to this circle of fifths for the keys https://bit.ly/32AVoum In the
future, I plan to add enharmonics, but one thing at a time

I plan to expand on this program in the future, making it more accessible for non music majors/minors. I also plan to add chords and intervals.
